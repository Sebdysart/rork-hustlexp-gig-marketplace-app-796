## üöß Known Issues & Limitations

### Expected Behavior (Not Bugs)

1. **New users won't have patterns**

   - Takes 2-3 days to build
   - Expected behavior

2. **Proactive alerts are conditional**
   - Only fire when conditions met
   - Throttled to 1 per hour
   - Can be disabled
   - By design

3. **Context updates require screen integration**
   - Each screen needs useEffect
   - Not automatic (intentional)
   - Allows screen-specific context

4. **Backend required for AI responses**
   - Works offline with cached data
   - Auto-reconnects when online
   - Status visible to user

## üí° Developer Notes

### Adding Context to Any Screen

```typescript
import { useUltimateAICoach } from '@/contexts/UltimateAICoachContext';

export default function MyScreen() {
  const aiCoach = useUltimateAICoach();
  const { currentUser, tasks } = useApp();
  
  useEffect(() => {
    aiCoach.updateContext({
      screen: 'my-screen',
      userLevel: currentUser.level,
      tasksVisible: tasks.length,
      // Add relevant data
    });
  }, [currentUser, tasks]);
}
```

### Triggering Proactive Alerts

Alerts fire automatically based on conditions:
- Streak expiring (2h before)
- Level up soon (80%+ progress)
- Perfect matches (95%+ score)
- Earnings opportunities (3+ high-pay)
- Badge progress (80%+ complete)

### Starting Tutorials

const { startTutorial } = useUltimateAICoach();

startTutorial({
  id: 'onboarding',
  title: 'Welcome Tour',
  steps: [
    {
      id: 'step-1',
      message: 'This is the home screen',
      position: { x: 0, y: 100, width: 300, height: 200 },
      arrowDirection: 'down',
    },
    // More steps...
  ],
  onComplete: (xp) => {
    console.log(`Tutorial complete! Earned ${xp} XP`);
  },
});
```
