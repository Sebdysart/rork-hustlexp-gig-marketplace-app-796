## 🧠 How It Works

### **Backend**
Uses your existing `hustleAI` backend:
```typescript
const response = await hustleAI.chat(userId, message);
```

### **Context Sent**
Every message includes user context:
```json
{
  "user": {
    "level": 12,
    "xp": 2450,
    "earnings": 1285,
    "streak": 15
  },
  "availableTasks": 23,
  "patterns": {
    "favoriteCategories": ["delivery", "pet_care"],
    "preferredWorkTimes": [9, 10, 11, 14, 15]
  }
}
```

So AI can give **personalized advice**.

### **Translation**
1. User message → Translate to English
2. AI processes in English
3. Response → Translate to user's language

Seamless! 🌍
