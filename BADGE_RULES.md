# Badge & Trophy System Rules

## üéØ Core Principles

1. **Fairness**: All badges must be achievable through legitimate effort
2. **Transparency**: Unlock conditions must be clear and visible
3. **Progression**: Badges should encourage continued engagement
4. **Anti-Fraud**: High-value badges require verification
5. **Accessibility**: All users can earn badges regardless of skill level

## üìã Badge Unlock Rules

### General Rules

1. **Idempotency**: Badge unlocks are idempotent - duplicate triggers are ignored
2. **Atomicity**: Badge unlocks are atomic - either fully awarded or not at all
3. **Irreversibility**: Once unlocked, badges cannot be removed (except for fraud)
4. **Visibility**: Locked badges show progress hints to guide users
5. **Rewards**: XP and GritCoins are awarded immediately upon unlock

### Verification Requirements
