## 🔍 Critical Validation Points

### Role → Mode Mapping (VERIFIED ✅)

| User Intent | Expected Mode | Profile Created | Test Status |
|------------|---------------|-----------------|-------------|
| `worker` + low price | `everyday` | No tradesmanProfile | ✅ PASS |
| `worker` + high price + trades | `tradesmen` | tradesmanProfile | ✅ PASS |
| `poster` | `business` | posterProfile | ✅ PASS |
| `both` | User selects | Both profiles | ✅ PASS |

### AI Recommendation Logic (VERIFIED ✅)

```typescript
// Poster ALWAYS goes to business
if (userIntent === 'poster') → 'business' ✅

// Worker analyzed based on inputs
if (userIntent === 'worker') {
  const avgPrice = (priceRange[0] + priceRange[1]) / 2;
  const hasProfessionalTrades = categories includes ['Plumbing', 'Electrical', etc.];
  
  if (hasProfessionalTrades && avgPrice > 400) → 'tradesmen' ✅
  else → 'everyday' ✅
}

// Both defaults to everyday, user can override
if (userIntent === 'both') → 'everyday' (then user selects) ✅
```

## 💡 Developer Notes

### Running Tests in Development
```bash
# Access test suite
http://localhost:8081/test-onboarding

# Or via navigation in app
router.push('/test-onboarding')
```

### Debugging Failed Tests
1. Check console logs for detailed error messages
2. Review test details dropdown for specific failures
3. Use "Sign Out & Reset" to clear state
4. Re-run individual test suites as needed

### Backend Optional
The backend integration tests are designed to gracefully fail if:
- Replit backend not deployed
- Backend URL not configured
- Network connectivity issues

This is intentional - the app works offline/without backend.
