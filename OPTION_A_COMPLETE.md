import { PredictiveTaskCard } from '@/components/PredictiveTaskCard';

// In your tasks screen
const predictions = await predictTaskMatches(
  availableTasks,
  currentUser,
  completedTasks,
  acceptedTasks
);

// Render top matches
{predictions.map((pred) => {
  const task = tasks.find(t => t.id === pred.taskId);
  return task ? (
    <PredictiveTaskCard
      key={task.id}
      task={task}
      prediction={pred}
      onAccept={handleAcceptTask}
    />
  ) : null;
})}
```

#### Smart Negotiations
```typescript
import { generateNegotiationStrategy } from '@/utils/aiSmartNegotiations';
import { SmartNegotiationPanel } from '@/components/SmartNegotiationPanel';

// In task detail screen
const [strategy, setStrategy] = useState<NegotiationSuggestion | null>(null);

const handleNegotiate = async () => {
  const strat = await generateNegotiationStrategy(
    task,
    currentUser,
    similarTasks,
    'balance'
  );
  setStrategy(strat);
};

{strategy && (
  <SmartNegotiationPanel
    suggestion={strategy}
    originalAmount={task.payAmount}
    onAcceptSuggestion={handleCounterOffer}
    onUseScript={handleCopyScript}
  />
)}
```

);

console.log(`Optimized route: ${optimized.totalDistance} km in ${optimized.totalDuration} mins`);
console.log(`Earnings: $${optimized.totalEarnings} ($${optimized.earningsPerHour}/hr)`);
console.log(`Savings: ${optimized.savingsVsUnoptimized.distanceSaved} km, ${optimized.savingsVsUnoptimized.timeSaved} mins`);
```
