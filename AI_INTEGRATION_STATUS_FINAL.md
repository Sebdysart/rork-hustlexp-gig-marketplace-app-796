## ðŸ“ž SUPPORT

### Common Issues

**Q: AI says "offline" but internet works?**
A: Backend server may be down. App still works in quick response mode.

**Q: Responses taking 8 seconds?**
A: Backend is slow/down. System falling back to mock mode for reliability.

**Q: How to get full AI features?**
A: Backend needs to be online. Check status indicator (tap to refresh).

**Q: Can I use app without AI?**
A: Yes! All core features work. AI enhances but isn't required.
