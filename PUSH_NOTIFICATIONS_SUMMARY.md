## 🔧 Technical Implementation

### Notification Flow:
1. **App Launch** → Request permissions → Register push token
2. **Notification Received** → Add to context → Show toast → Store in AsyncStorage
3. **User Taps Notification** → Navigate to relevant screen (if actionUrl provided)
4. **Test Button** → Trigger sample notification → Display in notification center

### Platform Support:
- ✅ **iOS**: Full support with proper permissions
- ✅ **Android**: Notification channels configured
- ⚠️ **Web**: Limited support (notifications logged but not displayed)

### Key Functions:
```typescript
// Register for push notifications
registerForPushNotifications(): Promise<string | null>

// Add notification to system
addNotification(userId, type, data): Promise<Notification>

// Mark as read
markAsRead(notificationId): Promise<void>

// Clear notifications
clearNotification(notificationId): Promise<void>
```
