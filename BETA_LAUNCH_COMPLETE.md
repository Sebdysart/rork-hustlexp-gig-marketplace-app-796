## 🐛 Known Issues / Future Enhancements

### Non-Blocking (can ship):
1. **HustleAI messages:** Don't filter by `aiNudgesEnabled` in Chat yet (requires backend)
2. **Lint warning:** Confetti useEffect missing `duration` dependency (intentional)
3. **Home screen:** Safe area linter warning (inherited from existing code)

### Post-Beta (Oct 27-Nov 15):
1. Add haptic feedback settings test (vibration on/off)
2. Add sound settings test (audio feedback)
3. Integrate backend for AI nudge filtering
4. Add unit tests for accessibility (react-native-testing-library)
