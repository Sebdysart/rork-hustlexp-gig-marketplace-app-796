3. Browse task feed (100 tasks loaded)
4. Tap a task to see details
5. Check Profile tab (XP, level, badges)

### **Step 3: Verify It Works** ✅
- App launches without errors

## 🛠️ **What Was Fixed Today**

### **Critical Bug Resolved:**
❌ **Before:** `app/index.tsx` crashed with:
```
Cannot destructure property 'currentUser' of 'useApp()' as it is undefined
```

✅ **After:** Changed to use `useUser()` hook directly:
```typescript
// OLD (broken)
const { currentUser } = useApp();

// NEW (working)
const { currentUser } = useUser();
```

### **Why This Matters:**
- `useApp()` is a composite hook that combines User, Tasks, and Economy contexts
- When app first loads, these contexts initialize asynchronously
- Using specific hooks (`useUser`, `useTasks`, `useEconomy`) is more reliable
- `AppProvider` is now only used in screens that need all three contexts

## 🚨 **Troubleshooting**

### **App won't start?**
```bash
# Clear cache and restart
bun start --clear
```

### **Seed data not loading?**
```typescript
// Clear AsyncStorage (in app)
import AsyncStorage from '@react-native-async-storage/async-storage';
AsyncStorage.clear();
```

### **TypeScript errors?**
```bash
# Check for type errors
npx tsc --noEmit
```

### **Context errors?**
- Make sure you're using specific hooks: `useUser()`, `useTasks()`, `useEconomy()`
- Avoid using `useApp()` in root screens (index, sign-in, etc.)
- Only use `useApp()` in screens that need all contexts

"HustleXP is different. It's AI-powered, gamified, and social. You earn XP, level up, and compete on leaderboards."

### **Scene 3: The Flow** (45 sec)
*Show onboarding → task feed → task details*  
"Sign up in 30 seconds. Browse tasks near you. See your match score. Apply in one tap."

### **Scene 4: The Magic** (30 sec)
*Show XP gain, confetti, level up*  
"Complete a task, earn XP, level up. Unlock badges. Climb the leaderboard. Build your hustle empire."

### **Scene 5: The Hook** (10 sec)
"HustleXP. The gig app that feels like a game. Coming to Seattle first."
