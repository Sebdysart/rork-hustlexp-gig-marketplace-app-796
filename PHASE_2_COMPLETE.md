**Date:** January 2025  
**Status:** ✅ COMPLETE  
**Progress:** 100%

---

## 🚀 WHAT WE BUILT

### 1. ✅ Real-Time Proactive Alert System
**File:** `contexts/UltimateAICoachContext.tsx`

**Features Implemented:**
- **Background Polling**: Checks every 5 minutes, alerts every 30 minutes
- **5 Types of Proactive Alerts:**
  1. **Streak Warning** (2 hours before expiry)
  2. **Level Up Soon** (80%+ progress to next level)
  3. **Perfect Task Matches** (95%+ match score based on patterns)
  4. **Earnings Opportunities** (3+ high-paying tasks in favorites)
  5. **Badge Progress** (80%+ completion)

**Smart Alert Logic:**
```typescript
// Streak expiry calculation
if (hoursRemaining <= 2 && hoursRemaining > 0) {
  await sendProactiveAlert('streak_warning', { ... });
}

// Perfect match scoring (70+ points = alert)
- Category match: 40 points
- Pay value match: 30 points (+ 10 bonus for 20% above average)
- Time preference: 20 points
```

**Throttling System:**
- Maximum 1 proactive alert per hour
- Prevents alert spam
- Respects user settings (can be turned off)

- "Earnings" - Check wallet

**Task Detail Screen:**
- "Accept Quest" - Execute action with confirmation

## 💡 HOW IT WORKS

### User Pattern Analysis
The AI learns from your behavior:
- Preferred work times (top 5 hours)
- Favorite categories (top 3)
- Average task value
- Completion speed (fast/medium/slow)
- Streak consciousness (high/medium/low)

### Proactive Intelligence Loop
```
Every 5 minutes:
  ├─ Check if 30 minutes passed since last alert
  ├─ Analyze current user state
  ├─ Check streak expiry
  ├─ Calculate XP progress
  ├─ Score available tasks
  ├─ Check badge progress
  └─ Send alert if conditions met
```

### Context-Aware Actions
```
User opens task detail:
  ├─ AI knows: taskId, pay, category, poster trust
  ├─ Shows "Accept Quest" button
  └─ Button triggers confirmation modal

User confirms:
  ├─ Action executes
  ├─ Success haptic feedback
  └─ AI sends confirmation message
```
