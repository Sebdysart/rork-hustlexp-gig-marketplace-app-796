# Translation Re-rendering Diagnosis

## Problem Summary
The app language is not changing to the desired language even though translations are loading successfully.

## Root Cause Analysis

### Issue 1: Cache Reference Comparison Bug
**Location:** `hooks/useTranslatedText.ts` line 65

```typescript
const hasChanged = prevTextsRef.current !== textsKey || 
                   prevLangRef.current !== currentLanguage ||
                   prevCacheRef.current !== aiTranslationCache; // ❌ BUG: Object reference never changes
```

**Problem:** 
- `prevCacheRef.current !== aiTranslationCache` compares object references
- The cache object is updated in-place, so the reference stays the same
- This means the hook never detects cache updates and never re-renders

**Fix:** Use a cache version/counter or compare stringified cache keys

### Issue 2: Missing Re-render Trigger
When translations finish loading in `LanguageContext`:
- Cache updates via `setAITranslationCache`
- But components using `useTranslatedTexts` don't re-render because of bug #1
- The `aiTranslationCache` dependency in useEffect doesn't trigger properly

## Frontend Fix Applied

I've updated `hooks/useTranslatedText.ts` to:
1. Use a stable cache key check instead of reference comparison
2. Force re-render when cache has new translations for current texts
3. Add proper memoization to prevent infinite loops

## Backend Confirmation Needed

### Question 1: Is the Translation API Working?
Please confirm:
```bash
curl -X POST https://lunch-garden-dycejr.replit.app/api/translate \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{
    "text": ["Hello", "Welcome"],
    "targetLanguage": "es",
    "sourceLanguage": "en"
  }'
```

Expected response:
```json
{
  "translations": ["Hola", "Bienvenido"]
}
```

### Question 2: Are There Rate Limits?
- Current limit: 120 requests/minute
- Is this being hit during language change?
- Check backend logs for rate limit errors

### Question 3: Check Backend Logs
When user changes language from English to Spanish, look for:
```
[Translation] POST /api/translate
[Translation] Batch size: 50
[Translation] Target: es
```

If you see:
- ❌ `429 Too Many Requests` → Rate limit needs increase
- ❌ `500 Internal Server Error` → Translation service issue
- ✅ `200 OK` → Backend is fine, it's a frontend bug (which I fixed)

## Test Case

1. Open app (should be in English)
2. Tap globe icon (top right)
3. Select "Español"
4. Wait 2-3 seconds
5. **Expected:** All text changes to Spanish
6. **Actual (before fix):** Text stays in English

## Error Logs to Share

Please check backend logs for these patterns:
```
[AI Translation] Translation failed: TypeError: Cannot set properties of undefined
Maximum update depth exceeded
```

These suggest:
1. Frontend making too many requests (causing loops)
2. Backend rejecting malformed requests

## Next Steps

**Frontend (Me):**
- ✅ Fixed cache comparison bug
- ✅ Added better re-render logic
- ✅ Improved error handling

**Backend (You):**
- [ ] Confirm translation endpoint is working
- [ ] Check if rate limits are being hit
- [ ] Share any error logs from recent translation attempts
- [ ] Verify response format matches: `{ translations: string[] }`

## Quick Test Commands

```bash
# Test translation endpoint
curl -X POST https://lunch-garden-dycejr.replit.app/api/translate \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{"text":["HustleXP","Level Up"],"targetLanguage":"es"}'
