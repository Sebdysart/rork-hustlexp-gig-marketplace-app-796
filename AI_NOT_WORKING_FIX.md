# üîß AI NOT WORKING - QUICK FIX GUIDE

## The Problem
Your AI Coach is showing: *"The AI backend is currently unavailable, but I can still help you navigate the app!"*

This means your **Replit backend is NOT connected** to the mobile app.

## üö® CRITICAL STEP: Run the Diagnostic First!

**Before anything else, navigate to this screen in your app:**

```
/ai-diagnostic
```

This diagnostic tool will tell you:
- ‚úÖ What's working
- ‚ùå What's broken
- üîß Exactly what to fix

## üéØ The Solution (Step by Step)

### Step 1: Check Your Replit Backend

1. Go to your Replit backend project
2. **Make sure the server is running!**
   - You should see logs like:
     ```
     Server running on port 5000
     All 9 AI endpoints ready
     Database seeded
     ```
3. If it's NOT running:
   - Click the green "Run" button in Replit
   - Wait for it to start

### Step 2: Get the Correct Backend URL

1. In Replit, look at the top of your browser
2. Copy the **exact domain**, for example:
   ```
   https://workspace-dycejr.replit.dev
   ```
   ‚ö†Ô∏è **DO NOT include /api at the end!**

### Step 3: Update Your .env File

1. Open `/mobile/.env` in your project
2. Replace ALL the URLs with your Replit domain:
   ```env
   EXPO_PUBLIC_API_URL=https://workspace-dycejr.replit.dev
   EXPO_PUBLIC_BACKEND_URL=https://workspace-dycejr.replit.dev
   EXPO_PUBLIC_HUSTLEAI_URL=https://workspace-dycejr.replit.dev
   EXPO_PUBLIC_WS_URL=wss://workspace-dycejr.replit.dev
   ```

### Step 4: Restart Your Mobile App

**THIS IS CRITICAL!** The app won't pick up new .env values until you restart.

1. Stop the app completely (Ctrl+C or close the terminal)
2. Start it again:
   ```bash
   npm start
   ```
3. Press `r` in the terminal to reload
4. Or on your device, shake to reload

## ‚úÖ How to Verify It's Working

### Test 1: Run the AI Diagnostic

Navigate to `/ai-diagnostic` in your app.

**You should see:**
- ‚úÖ All tests showing green checkmarks
- ‚úÖ "AI IS WORKING!" message at the top
- ‚úÖ AI Chat test shows `Using Mock: NO ‚úÖ`

**If you still see:**
- ‚ùå Red X marks
- ‚ö†Ô∏è "BACKEND NOT CONNECTED" warning
- ‚ö†Ô∏è AI Chat test shows `Using Mock: YES ‚ö†Ô∏è`

‚Üí Your backend is still not reachable. Go back to Step 1.

### Test 2: Use the AI Coach

1. Open the AI Coach (purple sparkle button)
2. Type: `hello`
3. Wait 8-15 seconds (real AI takes time)

**You should get:**
- A real, personalized response from GPT-4o
- NOT a fallback message about "backend unavailable"

## üîç Common Issues

### Issue 1: "Failed to fetch" Error

**Cause:** Your Replit backend is not running or the URL is wrong.

**Fix:**
1. Go to Replit and make sure your server is running
2. Check the URL in your .env matches your Replit domain exactly
3. Restart the mobile app

### Issue 2: "Timeout" Error

**Cause:** The backend is too slow or overloaded.

**Fix:**
1. Check your Replit backend logs for errors
2. Make sure your Replit plan has enough resources
3. Try again in a few seconds

### Issue 3: "Mock responses still showing"

**Cause:** The app is using cached environment variables.

**Fix:**
1. Clear the app completely (force close)
2. Restart the mobile app server
3. Use Shift+R for a fresh reload

### Issue 4: Using Physical Device (iPhone/Android)

**Problem:** `localhost` doesn't work on physical devices.

2. Update .env with the Replit domain
3. Restart the app
