# Backend Team: Translation System Status

## Current Situation

The translation API endpoint `/api/translate` is working correctly on your end. The issue is on the frontend where components aren't re-rendering when translations complete.

## What the backend team has confirmed:
✅ API endpoint is active  
✅ Rate limiting is working (120 requests/min)  
✅ Caching is enabled  
✅ All tests passing  

## What's happening on frontend:
❌ Components using `useTranslatedTexts()` hook don't re-render when language changes  
❌ Translations are loading but UI stays in English  
❌ Need to force component re-renders when translation cache updates  

## Request to Backend Team:

**No changes needed on your end.** The frontend is being fixed to properly handle translation updates and trigger re-renders.

However, for better debugging in the future, please ensure:

1. **Response format consistency**: Ensure `/api/translate` always returns:
   ```json
   {
     "translations": ["translated text 1", "translated text 2"]
   }
   ```

2. **Error responses include retry info**: When rate limited, return:
   ```json
   {
     "error": "Rate limit exceeded",
     "retryAfter": 60
   }
   ```

3. **Consider adding a /translate/status endpoint** to check:
   - Current rate limit status
   - Cache statistics
   - System health

## Testing the fix:

After the frontend fix is deployed, test by:
1. Opening the app
2. Click the globe icon (top right)
3. Select a non-English language (e.g., Spanish, French)
4. Watch the console logs - you should see "Translation loaded" messages
5. UI should update to show translated text within 5-10 seconds

## Console logs to monitor:

```
[Language] Changing language to: es
[Language] Preloading all translations for: es
[AI Translation] Translating 50 texts to es
[useTranslatedTexts] Re-rendering for language: es
[useTranslatedTexts] ✅ "HustleXP" → "HustleXP"
```

If translations still don't show after 30 seconds, then backend investigation is needed.

**Frontend fix is being applied now.**
