# HustleAI Backend Integration Status

## ✅ COMPLETED - Backend URL Updated

**Production Backend URL:** `https://lunch-garden-dycejr.replit.app/api`

The frontend is now connected to your published Replit backend.

---

## 🔌 Integration Status

### ✅ ALREADY INTEGRATED

Your app already has these critical integrations in place:

1. **✅ Feedback Loop (Task Completion)**
   - **File:** `contexts/AppContext.tsx` (Lines 375-387, 397-404)
   - **What it does:** Automatically submits feedback when tasks are completed
   - **Backend endpoint:** `POST /api/feedback`
   - **Data sent:** User ID, task ID, predicted vs actual XP, category, pay amount, completion time

2. **✅ A/B Experiment Tracking (Task Acceptance)**
   - **File:** `contexts/AppContext.tsx` (Lines 256-266)
   - **What it does:** Tracks experiment data when users accept tasks
   - **Backend endpoint:** `POST /api/experiments/track`
   - **Data sent:** Experiment ID, user ID, variant, outcome, task metrics

3. **✅ AI User Profile Fetching**
   - **File:** `contexts/AIProfileContext.tsx`
   - **File:** `app/(tabs)/home.tsx` (Lines 124-128)
   - **What it does:** Fetches personalized AI recommendations before showing tasks
   - **Backend endpoint:** `GET /api/users/:userId/profile/ai`
   - **Data received:** Preferred categories, acceptance rate, peak hours, recommendations

## 🧪 Testing Your Backend

### **New Test Screen Added:** `/backend-test`

A comprehensive testing screen has been created to verify your backend connection.

#### How to Access:
1. **Option 1:** Go to Admin Dashboard → Tap "Test HustleAI Backend Connection" button
2. **Option 2:** Navigate directly to `/backend-test` in your app

#### What It Tests:
- ✅ Health Check (`/api/health`)
- ✅ AI Chat (`/api/agent/chat`)
- ✅ Feedback Loop (`/api/feedback`)
- ✅ AI User Profile (`/api/users/:id/profile/ai`)
- ✅ A/B Testing (`/api/experiments/track`)

#### Test Results:
The test screen will show you:
- ✅ **Green checkmark** = Endpoint working
- ❌ **Red X** = Endpoint not responding
- **Summary:** X/5 tests passed

## 📋 What's Working Now

### 1. AI Learning Feedback Loop
**When:** After every task completion
**What happens:**
- App sends predicted XP reward to backend
- Backend compares it with actual XP earned
- AI learns from the difference and improves future predictions

**Example:**
```typescript
hustleAI.submitFeedback({
  userId: 'user-123',
  taskId: 'task-456',
  predictionType: 'completion',
  predictedValue: 85,
  actualValue: 92,
  context: {
    category: 'delivery',
    payAmount: 50,
    completionTime: 25,
  }
});
```

### 2. A/B Experiment Tracking
**When:** When user accepts a task
**What happens:**
- App assigns user to experiment variant (control/test_a/test_b)
- Tracks acceptance outcome and metrics
- Backend analyzes which variant performs better

**Example:**
```typescript
hustleAI.trackExperiment({
  experimentId: 'task_acceptance_v1',
  userId: 'user-123',
  variant: 'control',
  outcome: 'success',
  metrics: {
    taskPrice: 50,
    xpReward: 100,
    userLevel: 10,
  }
});
```

### 3. AI User Profiles
**When:** Home screen loads, before showing task list
**What happens:**
- App fetches user's AI profile with learned preferences
- Pre-filters tasks based on user behavior
- Shows "Why this task?" recommendations

**Example:**
```typescript
const profile = await hustleAI.getUserProfileAI('user-123');
// Returns: {
//   preferredCategories: ['delivery', 'pet_care'],
//   avgTaskPrice: 45,
//   peakActiveHours: [9, 14, 18],
//   acceptanceRate: 0.82,
//   recommendations: ['Try tasks around 3PM for better matches']
// }
```

## 🚀 How to Verify Everything Works

### Step 1: Run the Backend Test
1. Open your app
2. Navigate to **Admin Dashboard** (or `/admin`)
3. Tap **"Test HustleAI Backend Connection"**
4. Wait for tests to complete (~10-15 seconds)
5. **Expected Result:** 5/5 tests should pass ✅

### Step 2: Verify AI Learning in Action
1. Complete a task as a worker
2. Check console logs for:
   ```
   [HUSTLEAI] Feedback submitted for task completion
   ```
3. Open your Replit backend logs
4. **Expected:** You should see the feedback being received and processed

### Step 3: Check AI Profile Fetch
1. Refresh the home screen
2. Check console logs for:
   ```
   [Home] Fetching AI profile for user: user-123
   ```
3. **Expected:** AI profile should be fetched before tasks load

## 🔧 Troubleshooting

### If Backend Tests Fail

**Problem:** "Backend unavailable" or timeout errors

**Solutions:**
1. **Check Replit Deployment:**
   - Go to your Replit project
   - Ensure it's **published** and **running**
   - Check the deployment URL matches: `https://lunch-garden-dycejr.replit.app`

2. **Check Network:**
   - Try accessing the backend URL in your browser
   - Expected response: `{"status":"ok","version":"1.0.0"}`

3. **Check Logs:**
   - Open your browser's Developer Console (F12)
   - Look for `[HUSTLEAI]` log messages
   - Any errors will show details about what's failing

### If Some Tests Pass, But Others Fail

This means your backend is online but some endpoints aren't working:

1. **Health passes, Chat fails:**
   - Your OpenAI API key might be missing or invalid
   - Check Replit environment variables

2. **All pass except Feedback/Experiments:**
   - These endpoints might need database setup
   - Check Replit logs for error messages

---

## 📊 Expected Console Output

When everything is working, you should see:

```
[HUSTLEAI] Client initialized with base URL: https://lunch-garden-dycejr.replit.app/api
[Home] Fetching AI profile for user: user-123
[HUSTLEAI] GET https://lunch-garden-dycejr.replit.app/api/users/user-123/profile/ai
[HUSTLEAI] Response received
[HUSTLEAI] POST https://lunch-garden-dycejr.replit.app/api/experiments/track
[HUSTLEAI] Response received
[HUSTLEAI] Feedback submitted for task completion
[HUSTLEAI] POST https://lunch-garden-dycejr.replit.app/api/feedback
[HUSTLEAI] Response received
```

## 🎯 What Happens When Backend is Down?

Your app has **graceful fallbacks**:

- ❌ Backend down → App uses **mock responses**
- ✅ Core features still work (tasks, messages, ratings)
- ⚠️ AI features show placeholder data
- 📝 Logs show warnings but app doesn't crash

**Example:**
```
[HUSTLEAI] Backend unavailable, using mock response
[HUSTLEAI] Falling back to mock chat response
```
