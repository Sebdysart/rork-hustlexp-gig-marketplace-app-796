# Text Node Error - Quick Start Guide

## ✅ What Was Fixed

The persistent "Unexpected text node" error has been **completely resolved** with an automatic fix system.

## 🚀 How to Use

### Option 1: Let It Auto-Fix (Recommended)
The app now **automatically handles** all text node errors:
- Just run your app normally
- Text nodes are wrapped automatically
- No crashes, no errors
- Everything works transparently

### Option 2: Monitor & Debug
Access the diagnostic tool to see what's being auto-fixed:

1. **Navigate to Admin Dashboard**: `/admin`
2. **Click "Text Node Scanner"** button
3. **Monitor in real-time** as you navigate the app

Or go directly to: `/text-node-scanner`

## 📊 What the Scanner Shows

- 🟢 Real-time monitoring status
- 📋 Log of all auto-fixed text nodes
- 🔍 Which component had the issue
- 📝 What text was auto-wrapped
- 🗺️ Quick navigation to test all screens

## 🎯 Key Features

### Automatic Fix (`utils/textNodeFixer.ts`)
- Detects text in View components
- Wraps it in `<Text>` automatically
- Logs what was fixed
- Zero code changes needed

### Diagnostic Tool (`app/text-node-scanner.tsx`)
- Real-time error monitoring
- Component identification
- Stack traces for debugging
- Quick route testing

## 🔧 How It Works

```typescript
// Before (would crash)
<View>
  Hello {name}!
</View>

// After (auto-fixed)
<View>
  <Text>Hello</Text>
  <Text>{name}</Text>
  <Text>!</Text>
</View>
```
