## Strategy
Continue adding `useTranslatedTexts` hook to each file systematically:
1. Import the hook
2. Define translation keys array
3. Replace hardcoded strings with translation array indices
4. Test language switching

## Time Estimate
- Remaining ~180 files 
- Average 5 min/file = 900 minutes (15 hours)
- Need multiple sessions to complete

## Note to User
The translation system is working! Each file I update will instantly support all 12 languages when you change the language using the globe icon. However, completing all 200+ files will require continued work across multiple sessions.
