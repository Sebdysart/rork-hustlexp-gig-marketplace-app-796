1. `POST /api/ai/chat` - Main AI brain
2. `GET /api/ai/tier-info/:userId` - Tier system
3. `GET /api/dashboard/unified/:userId` - Dashboard data

**Priority 2:** Implement matching (Week 2)
4. `POST /api/ai/match-task` - Task recommendations
5. `POST /api/ai/recommendations` - Proactive suggestions

**Priority 3:** Complete AI system (Week 3-4)
6. `POST /api/ai/task-parse` - Natural language parser
7. `POST /api/ai/analyze-patterns` - User behavior analysis
8. `POST /api/ai/feedback` - Learning loop

**Optional:** Multi-modal (Week 5-6)
9. `POST /api/ai/voice-to-task` - Voice commands
10. `POST /api/ai/image-match` - Image analysis

### For Frontend Team (You):

**Immediate:**
1. Create `.env` file:
   ```bash
   EXPO_PUBLIC_BACKEND_URL=https://your-backend.replit.app
   EXPO_PUBLIC_ENABLE_AI_FEATURES=true
   ```

2. Test backend connection:
   ```bash
   npm start
   # Check AI Coach for "Backend Status: Online"
   ```

3. Verify tier system:

## 🎨 Tier System Quick Reference

### 5 Tiers, 50 Levels, Infinite Progression

| Tier | Levels | Fee | XP | AI Personality |

| 🏛️ **The Architect** | 31-40 | 7% | 2.0x | Elite Consultant |
| 👑 **Prestige** | 41+ | 5% | 3.0x | Autonomous Partner |

### Fee Savings Example:

**User completes $1000 worth of tasks:**
- **Level 5 (Side Hustler):** Pays $150 fee (15%)
- **Level 15 (The Operator):** Pays $120 fee (12%) - Saves $30
- **Level 25 (Rainmaker):** Pays $100 fee (10%) - Saves $50
