# Unified Profile System - Implementation Summary

## Overview
Created a comprehensive unified profile system that provides a seamless experience for viewing both your own profile and other users' profiles, with progressive backgrounds, advanced badge showcasing, and smooth role-specific onboarding.

## Key Features Implemented

### 1. **Unified Profile Component** (`components/UnifiedProfile.tsx`)
- Single component handles both own profile and viewing others
- Dynamic background gradients that evolve with user level:
  - Level 1-24: Basic gradient (Green → Cyan → Blue)
  - Level 25-49: Advanced gradient (Blue → Cyan → Violet)
  - Level 50-74: Elite gradient (Cyan → Blue → Violet)
  - Level 75-99: Master gradient (Violet → Magenta → Cyan)
  - Level 100+: Legendary gradient (Amber → Magenta → Violet)

### 2. **Progressive Badge System**
- Badges advance through tiers as you complete more tasks
- Call of Duty-style progression system
- 6 badge categories with multiple tiers each:
  - **Hustler** (7 tiers): Bronze → Silver → Gold → Platinum → Diamond → Master → Legendary
  - **Speed Demon** (4 tiers): Quick Worker → Speed Runner → Lightning Fast → Speed Demon
  - **Money Maker** (5 tiers): Penny Pincher → Money Maker → Big Earner → Wealth Builder → Tycoon
  - **Streak Master** (5 tiers): Consistent → Dedicated → Committed → Unstoppable → Eternal Flame
  - **Level Master** (6 tiers): Novice → Apprentice → Expert → Master → Grandmaster → Legend
  - **XP Grinder** (5 tiers): XP Collector → XP Hunter → XP Farmer → XP Master → XP Legend

### 3. **Trophy Case & Badge Showcase**
- Top 6 most advanced badges displayed prominently

- "View All" button to see complete badge library
- Badges sorted by tier (highest first)

### 4. **Public Profile Features**
When viewing other users:

- View stats (XP, quests completed, rating)
- Rate users after working together
- Report users if needed
- See verification badges
- View current tier and level

### 5. **Own Profile Features**
When viewing your own profile:

### 6. **Clickable Leaderboard**
- All leaderboard entries are now clickable
- Tap any user to view their full profile
- Smooth animations on press
- Works for both podium (top 3) and list entries

### 7. **Smooth Role-Specific Onboarding**
The onboarding flow (`app/onboarding.tsx`) guides users through:
1. **Welcome Screen**: Choose your role
2. **Location Setup**: Set your location for local tasks
3. **Profile Creation**: Name and bio
4. **Role-Specific Tips**:

## Technical Implementation

### Component Structure
```typescript
<UnifiedProfile
  user={user}                    // User to display
  isOwnProfile={boolean}         // Own profile vs viewing others
  onUpdateUser={async (user) => {}}  // Update user callback
  onRateUser={async (rating, comment) => {}}  // Rate user callback
  onReportUser={async (reason, description) => {}}  // Report user callback
  myAcceptedTasks={tasks[]}      // For earnings calculations
/>
```

### Badge Progression System
```typescript
// Get user's unlocked badges
const unlockedBadges = getAllUnlockedBadges(user);

// Get top badges (sorted by tier)
const topBadges = unlockedBadges
  .sort((a, b) => b.tier.tier - a.tier.tier)
  .slice(0, 6);
```

### Background Gradient Logic
```typescript
const getBackgroundGradient = (): [string, string, ...string[]] => {
  if (user.level >= 100) return [amber, magenta, violet];
  if (user.level >= 75) return [violet, magenta, cyan];
  if (user.level >= 50) return [cyan, blue, violet];
  if (user.level >= 25) return [blue, cyan, green];
  return [primary, secondary, accent];
};
```
