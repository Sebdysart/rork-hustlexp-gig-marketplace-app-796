# Infinite Loop Error Fix Summary

## Problem
The app was experiencing "Maximum update depth exceeded" errors, causing the app to crash repeatedly. This error occurs when a component calls setState inside useEffect with dependencies that change on every render, creating an infinite loop.

## Root Cause
In `app/index.tsx` (Welcome Screen), the `useEffect` hook at line 57 had the following issues:

1. **Using state variable in callback**: The animation callback was using `particles` state variable instead of the local `newParticles` variable
2. **Dependency array problem**: The empty dependency array `[]` didn't match what the effect was actually using

## Files Fixed

### 1. app/index.tsx
**Issue**: The useEffect was accessing the `particles` state variable inside an animation callback, which would change every render.

**Fix**:
- Changed `particles.forEach` to `newParticles.forEach` (lines 116-118)
- This ensures the effect uses the locally created particles array instead of the state variable
- Added ESLint disable comment for the exhaustive-deps warning since this effect should only run once on mount

**Code Changes**:
```typescript
// Before (Line 116):
particles.forEach((particle, index) => {
  const angle = (Math.PI * 2 * index) / particles.length;

// After:
newParticles.forEach((particle, index) => {
  const angle = (Math.PI * 2 * index) / newParticles.length;
```

### 2. contexts/NotificationContext.tsx
**Issue**: The cleanup function was trying to use a deprecated/non-existent method `Notifications.removeNotificationSubscription()`

**Fix**:
- Changed to use the correct `.remove()` method on the subscription objects
- Added proper null checks before calling remove

**Code Changes**:
```typescript
// Before (Lines 76-81):
return () => {
  if (Platform.OS !== 'web') {
    notificationListener.current?.remove();
    responseListener.current?.remove();
  }
};

// After:
return () => {
  if (Platform.OS !== 'web') {
    if (notificationListener.current) {
      notificationListener.current.remove();
    }
    if (responseListener.current) {
      responseListener.current.remove();
    }
  }
};
```

## Why This Fixes the Infinite Loop

1. **Breaking the dependency cycle**: By using `newParticles` instead of `particles`, the animation callbacks no longer depend on state that changes
2. **Stable references**: The `newParticles` array is created once inside the useEffect and never changes
3. **One-time execution**: The effect now truly runs only once on mount, as intended by the empty dependency array

## Testing
After these changes:
- The app should load without crashing
- Animations should work properly
- No more "Maximum update depth exceeded" errors
- Notification subscriptions are properly cleaned up

## Prevention Tips
To avoid similar issues in the future:
1. Always use local variables created inside useEffect instead of state variables when possible
2. Be careful with empty dependency arrays - ensure the effect doesn't use any values that change
3. Use `useCallback` and `useMemo` with proper dependencies when creating functions/objects used in effects
4. Check API documentation for correct cleanup methods
