## 🔧 How to Use

### Track Events
```typescript
import { useAnalytics } from '@/contexts/AnalyticsContext';

const { trackEvent } = useAnalytics();

// Track any event
await trackEvent('task_completed', {
  taskId: '123',
  category: 'cleaning',
  duration: 3600,
  earnings: 50
});
```

### Access Metrics
```typescript
const { metrics, cohorts, funnels } = useAnalytics();

console.log('DAU:', metrics?.dau);
console.log('Retention 7d:', metrics?.retentionRate7d);
console.log('Latest Cohort:', cohorts[0]);
```

### Generate Reports
```typescript
const { generateCohortReport, generateFunnelReport } = useAnalytics();

// Generate last 8 weeks of cohorts
await generateCohortReport(8);

// Generate custom funnel
await generateFunnelReport('Custom Funnel', [
  'event_1',
  'event_2',
  'event_3'
]);
```

### Refresh Data
```typescript
const { refreshMetrics, refreshCohorts, refreshFunnels } = useAnalytics();

await refreshMetrics();  // Recalculate all metrics
await refreshCohorts();  // Reload cohort data
await refreshFunnels();  // Reload funnel data
```

## 📈 Key Metrics Explained

### DAU/WAU/MAU
- **DAU**: Unique users in last 24 hours
- **WAU**: Unique users in last 7 days
- **MAU**: Unique users in last 30 days
- **Ratio**: DAU/WAU measures "stickiness"

### Retention
- **Day 1**: % of users who return 1 day after signup
- **Day 7**: % of users who return 7 days after signup
- **Day 30**: % of users who return 30 days after signup

### Churn
- **Definition**: % of active users who became inactive
- **Calculation**: (Users lost) / (Users at start of period)

### Growth Rate
- **Definition**: Week-over-week signup growth
- **Calculation**: ((This week - Last week) / Last week) × 100

## 🔒 Data Storage

### AsyncStorage Keys
- `hustlexp_analytics` - Raw event data (max 1000 events)
- `hustlexp_cohorts` - Cohort analysis results
- `hustlexp_funnels` - Funnel analysis results (max 50)

### Data Retention
- Events: Last 1000 events (FIFO)
- Cohorts: All generated cohorts
- Funnels: Last 50 funnel reports

## 🚀 Performance Considerations

### Optimizations
- Memoized context values with useMemo
- Callback memoization with useCallback
- Efficient array operations
- Indexed event lookups
- Batch operations where possible

### Memory Management
- Auto-cleanup of old events
- Limit on stored funnel reports
- Efficient Set operations for unique users

## 🎯 Growth Insights

### What to Monitor
1. **User Acquisition**: Track new user signups
2. **Activation**: Monitor onboarding completion rate
